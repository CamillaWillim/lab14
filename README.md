# Lab 14
The missing lab class

This last and obviously very important lab class requires all the skills that you aquired this semester. The description of the problem, not even speaking of how to solve it, requires more space than what we have here. Hence, this can only be done verbally. Over a beer. Hence the following announcement.

# The missing lab class 
### Wednesday, 10.2., 19:00
### at [Scotti's](http://www.scottis.de/)

As it is good tradition with our lectures, we want to conclude the semester by having a nice evening with you guys :beers: :cocktail: :hamburger: We invite you to meet us at Scotti's on Wednesday the 10th February at 19 o'clock. 

Scotti's is close to the university and easily reached by tram as it is right next to the tram stop Christophstra√üe which is served by the lines 701, 707 and 713. 

We're looking forward to seeing plenty of you guys around next week!
